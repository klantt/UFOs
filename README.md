# Module 11 UFOs

### Overview 

  - This week I worked alongside Dana who is wanting to learn more about Javascript. Some topics she is curious about include the functions of the language, and how many versions are currently out. She quickly discovers that JavaScript has been out since 1995 and that they're tons of different versions out for use. After helping Dana with JavaScript we are to look into her research about UFO's and help her plan out a webpage users can interact with and usiong functional filters and tables to display the data cleanly. 

### Summary

  - In conclusion I learned a kit with this project wether it was styling the webpage or pulling images in to display and then in the end setting up an in depth search to find different locations / dates. 
  - Feel that we could have improved the website and streamlined the process by deleting some of the drop down options or filters to make the search a little quicker by just asking state and date or city and state and then just listing results by years instead of having a seperate options for years the user could just view years listed after the search and choose from there. 
  - In total I think the website was very easy to use and visually pleasing to look at.
