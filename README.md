# Module 11 UFOs

### Overview 

  - This week I worked alongside Dana who is wanting to learn more about Javascript. Some topics she is curious about include the functions of the language, and how many versions are currently out. She soon quickly discovers that JavaScript has been out since 1995 and that they're tons of different versions out for use. After helping Dana with JavaScript we are to look into her research about UFO's and help her plan out a webpage users can interact with and usiong functional filters and tables to display the data cleanly.
